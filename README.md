# VulnerabilityClassifier
Vulnerability severity scoring and categorisation using machine-learning tools. VulnerabilityClassifier is an open-source toolkit that employs machine-learning techniques to learn vulnerability labels assigned by [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/full-listing), vendors, [cvedetails](https://www.cvedetails.com/), and other repositories, in order to predict the labels for new vulnerability reports. Here, "labels" refers to [CVSS](https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document)-metric labels, threat types provided by [cvedetails](https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerabilities-by-types.php). More works related to weakness types provided by [CWE](https://cwe.mitre.org/index.html), attack types provided by [CAPEC](https://capec.mitre.org/index.html) would be added in the future. The purpose is to support a higher level of automation in vulnerability assessment.
