# VulnerabilityClassifier
Vulnerability severity scoring and categorisation using machine-learning tools. VulnerabilityClassifier is an open-source toolkit that employs machine-learning techniques to learn vulnerability labels assigned by [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/full-listing), vendors, [cvedetails](https://www.cvedetails.com/), and other repositories, in order to predict the labels for new vulnerability reports. Here, "labels" refers to [CVSS](https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document)-metric labels, threat types provided by [cvedetails](https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerabilities-by-types.php). The purpose is to support a higher level of automation in vulnerability assessment.

## Severity Prediction Under CVSS Version 3 Standard

The purpose here is to be able to automatically assign a severity score to any vulnerability instance with a descriptive report, using the CVSS Version 3 standard. Two examples are shown below, whereby the TestingSamples have labels initially set as (CVSS score = 0) and other values as "l", and the labels of the PredictedSamples are predicted by the trained machine-learning models.

### Tutorial in Jupiter Notebook
A severity computation pipeline that streamlines the process of machine-learning model training, testing, and validation is illustrated in the [Notebook](https://github.com/Yuni0217/VulnerabilityClassifier/blob/main/CVSSV3prediction/predictionForCVSSVersion3UseLR.ipynb), in a step-by-step manner. In this tutorial, [Logistic Regression](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html) algorithm is utilised to show the applicability of the proposed approach. Any other machine-learning model can be applied to further improve the model performances.

## Severity Prediction Under CVSS Version 2 Standard

Similarly, vulnerability severity score under CVSS Version 2 can be predicted using trained machine-learning model.

### Tutorial in Jupiter Notebook
The model training, testing, validation process is illustrated in the [Notebook](https://github.com/Yuni0217/VulnerabilityClassifier/blob/main/CVSSV3prediction/predictionForCVSSVersion3UseLR.ipynb), in a step-by-step manner, while using Logistic Regressiong as an example.


## Future Works
More classification works related to weakness types provided by [CWE](https://cwe.mitre.org/index.html), attack types provided by [CAPEC](https://capec.mitre.org/index.html) would be added.
